    <h1>Lab 10: Javascript Events and Forms</h1>
    <p>In this lab, my partner and I linked our javascript to our html, modifying
    the DOM and (well -- attempted to) create a responsive form that takes user
    input and outputting the same name scrambling as the window prompt from lab 7.
    </p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>This lab was particularly challenging because we had an overall sense of
    event listeners and events + forms, but we had a hard time putting it all
    together.  There were a good bit of missing pieces which would put everything
    together properly, but nonetheless we ended up applying knowledge About
    each of the elements individually.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Here it is. Lacking in some functionality currently but stay tuned for a
    functional and interactive form/event!</p>
    <form>
    <h2>Hello</h2>
      <label for="fullname">Input your Name: </label><br>
      <input type="text" id="user-name" name="fullname"><br>
      <button id="my-button">Click Me!</button>
    </form>
</body>
