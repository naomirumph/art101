    <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>

    <p>The objective of this lab was to create a function that outputs a Hogwarts
		house according to the name that is input using Javascript conditionals.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p> This lab gave my partner and I the most grief out of all of them. We had a
			lot of issues getting the script to run properly.  Namely, some syntax errors
		and minute misspelling gave us the most grief.  We also understood the premise
		of creating a function in conjunction that would output blurbs for each of the houses
 		but ultimately decided to research going forward but put out what we had.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>This page works! Albeit not the most aesthetically pleasing, our function
		takes a name as input and outputs a hogwarts house so i would consider that a
	 	success of some sort!</p>
