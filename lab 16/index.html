  <h1> Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>
  <h2>The Objective:</h2>
  <p>In this lab, the objective was to experiment with processing JSON from an
  API.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>In this lab, my partner and I accessed the API for an xkcd comic.
    The most challenging part about this lab was the fact that I struggled to
   fully grasp the vocabulary.  My shortcomings from struggling with AJAX really
   contributed to making this lab difficult.  My working understanding of JSON
   and API’s was pretty weak, so right off the bat I had some difficulty writing
   the javascript and getting things to function properly.  This lab furthered my
   understanding of APIs and how JSON works, however I did still fall short in
   some elements.  After fiddling with the CORS error and trying to resolve it
   for a bit, we decided to go back in,  line by line to look for any errors in
   functions or missed defining variables.  We also found no syntax errors but
   it was very possible that our eyes were tired from reading it over and over
   again.  We finally got an image to show up above our ‘next’ and ‘previous’
   buttons, however it was broken.  Alas, a broken image was better than none
   and we have remained stuck here. Hoping to have some fresh eyes look over and
   see what we’re missing or did wrong in our javascript and html.   </p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
