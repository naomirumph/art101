	<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
				<img src="img/redpriusdusty.jpeg" width=300 length=250/>
	<p>Working with Ethan, we experimented with basic javascript data types and
		inputting defining variables.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>he challenges we faced for this lab were entirely based around Task 1.
			 We had a lot of small syntax errors that would result in error messages.
			 It took a lot of backtracking and digging into lecture slides and stack
			 exchange to figure out what the problem was. Assigning the number to myMainRide
			  didn't quite go smoothly initially, but eventually after a ton (emphasis on ton,)
			 of trial and error we were able to properly	assign our variables to the objects.
		 </p>
<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>In the end, we managed to figure everything out and wound up with this glorious,
	 working lab page! Lab 6 was challenging in the sense that we had to meticulously
 	review our steps in order to figure out where the errors came from.</p>
