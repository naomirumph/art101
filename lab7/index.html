					<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
					<p>Working with my partner, we wrote functions that took user input.</p>
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>The biggest challenge we had during this lab was small syntax errors
					that led to the program not being able to run. We ended up getting a
					third pair of eyes to help us find the error because we had been staring
					at the js document for too long. It turned out we had a typo which led
					to nameArray not being properly defined as a variable. </p>
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Once we got our variable defined and the technical errors ironed out
					things were smooth sailing and this functional page was created!</p>
