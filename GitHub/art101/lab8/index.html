            <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
            <p>In this lab, I worked with my partner to experiment with anonymous
            functions and callbacks.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>We found this lab to be pretty straight forward once we got started.
            Once again, an issue we ran into was small syntax errors, like the
            ommision of a semi-colon or something of the same caliber. When
            all of those blips and reference errors were sorted, things ran smoothly.
           </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Check the console for properly functioning anon functions +
            callbacks!</p>
